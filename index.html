            <h2>Passions</h2>

            <p>My passion is reading mangas above all else. I particularly love the sports mangas like "Kuroko no Basket" or "Haikyu". But my favorite book remains, above all, "is Hajime no Ippo" of George Morikawa. Otherwise, I also like to learn the body anatomy by improving the efficiency of my bodybuilding's sessions</p>
